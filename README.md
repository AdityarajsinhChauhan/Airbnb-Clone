# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Airbnb Clone

This is a clone of the Airbnb website created for practice and showcasing front-end development skills. It replicates the look and feel of Airbnb using their icons and images, but it is not an official Airbnb product. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by Airbnb in any way. Some UI elements, images, and the logo have been used to replicate the look and feel of the original website

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- React.js – For building the front-end
- Tailwind CSS – For styling

## 📌 Features
- Airbnb-like UI with icons and images for a familiar look.
- Locally stored data for improved performance.
- Designed specifically for PC screens (not fully responsive for all devices).

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This project is created only for learning purposes. It does not provide real functionality like booking or authentication.

## 🎯 Future Improvements
- Make the website fully responsive.
- Add dynamic data fetching instead of using locally stored data.
